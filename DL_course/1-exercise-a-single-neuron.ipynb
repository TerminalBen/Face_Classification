Tensors are basically TensorFlow's version of a Numpy array with a few differences that make them better suited to deep learning.

TPUs, in fact, are designed specifically for tensor computations.\n\nA model's weights are kept in its `weights` attribute as a list of tensors. Get the weights of the model you defined above.
